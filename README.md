**Steps to running the app**

1. Clone the app to your local machine
2. run yarn install to install all dependencies (if you are using npm, delete the yarn lock file and run npm install)
3. run npm test or yarn test depending on what you are using to run the available test for the programme.

**Note:** After every test suite, the json file record is reset. You can always run the app via index.js in the root folder and play around with different values and calling any of the methods you deem fit
